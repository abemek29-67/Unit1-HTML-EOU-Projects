            <h3>My Backround</h3>

            <p><strong>Im</strong> a freshman <strong>attending Bergen Country Technical high school in <br>
                    Teterboro New Jersey</strong> with <strong>computer science as my major
                </strong> of choice.<br>The reasoning of my chocie to take <strong>computer science</strong>
                as my major is <br> becuase it <strong>is a rapid growing feild</strong> with many opportunites
                to gain <br> knowledge about what will dominate the entirety our future.
                All the <br> aspects of coding are also intruiging and fun which in many ways like <br>
                learning an actual language but your communicating with a computer <br>
                instead of a person so the computer can communiate with another person</p>

            <p>
                Outside of school I enjoy things like video games sports and other mixes <br>
                of outdoor and indoor activities in order to keep me entertained. <br>
                Im very enthusiastic of the development im making in my prgramming skills and <br>
                cant wait to further my education in this school.
