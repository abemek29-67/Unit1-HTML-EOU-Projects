            <p>Fishing is a hobby I picked up around two years ago and it has <br>
                been amazing. I have an ugly stick gx2 rod and its a beginner <br>
                rod so its 5 feet in length. My favorite species of fish to catch are <br>
                largemouth bass and blue gill becuase I like the fight that they <br>
                put up.

                break from life or work. They bring me happines and let me release the stress <br>
                that gets bottled up during the day.

            <h2>How My Interests Are Connected to CS</h2>

            <p>
                Soccer is a very demanding sport which requires disipline and effort. <br>
                The things I learned my 6 years of experience in the sport can and are applied <br>
                to my work in school specifically my work in my major. Fishing teaches patience <br>
                with rewards at the end. When im struggling in a certain area of life acedemic or <br>
                not I can apply the virtue of patience I learned through fishing in order to remain <br>
                calm and collected and then focus leading to rewards to success.
